# Home Assistant Compatibility

What Home Assistant versions this integration supports and the status of any changing core APIs.

**Reviewed 2026-09-30.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **Nothing in this integration requires action before Home Assistant 2027.8.** All version-sensitive Home Assistant APIs are either shimmed with dynamic fallbacks or pass explicit parameters.

## Supported versions

| Type | Version / Status | Note |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Minimum** | **2025.2.0** | Declared in `README.md` |
| **Tested against** | **2026.9.4** | `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component` 0.13.367 (development container) |
| **Enforced by** | `hacs.json` | `"homeassistant": "2025.2.0"` |
| **Functional floor** | `ConfigFlowResult`, action schemas | Established in HA 2024.8 |
| **Python** | 3.13 or later | Required by Home Assistant 2025.2.0. Tests run on Python 3.14 |

## Deprecation & compatibility ledger

| API / Feature | Deprecated in | Removed in | Integration Exposure | Status |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `DeviceInfo.via_device` identifier tuple | 2026.8 | **2027.8** | Sub-device parent links | **Shimmed** — `_compat.via_device_link()` |
| `async_get_device(identifiers=…)` | 2026.8 | **2027.8** | Sub-device lookups | **Shimmed** — `_compat.device_by_identifier()` |
| Implicit coordinator `config_entry` detection | 2024.8 | **2026.8** | `DataUpdateCoordinator` | **Done** — passed explicitly |
| `BaseTrackerEntity.battery_level` | 2026.6 | **2027.7** | None — no tracker platform | **N/A** |
| `TrackerEntity.location_name` | 2026.6 | **2027.7** | None — no tracker platform | **N/A** |
| `voluptuous` imports | N/A (replaced by probatio in 2026.9) | None announced | Config flow and schemas | **Compatible**: HA aliases `voluptuous` to probatio via `install_as_voluptuous()` |
| Flow and service schema types (probatio) | 2026.10, type hints only | None announced | `voluptuous` imports in the config flow, services and schemas | **Compliant**: runtime is unaffected, and a shared `pyproject.toml` override makes Mypy treat `voluptuous` as untyped. Mypy Strict passes against core `dev`. |
| Device-class enums in `const` modules | 2026.10, type hints only | None announced | `BinarySensorDeviceClass`, `ButtonDeviceClass` imported from the platform package | **Compliant**: the package re-export still works, and a shared `pyproject.toml` override makes Mypy count it as an export. Mypy Strict passes against core `dev`. |

## Upcoming milestones

- **Home Assistant 2027.8:** When core removes the legacy `via_device` tuple and `async_get_device` identifier lookups, the legacy branches in `_compat.py` can be retired. Until then, `_compat.py` provides transparent backward and forward compatibility without raising warnings.
- **Home Assistant 2026.10:** core types flow and service schemas as probatio and moves the device-class enums to `const` modules. This affects type checking only. The two Mypy overrides in the shared `pyproject.toml` are removed when the integration imports probatio directly or the floor passes the move.
